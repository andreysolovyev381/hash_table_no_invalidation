## Hash table with no invalidation of pointers and iterators

### Rational
Another project of mine required a hash table that never invalidates its pointers and iterators. I made one in the hope that it would be on par with `std::unordered`. Header only, single C++20 file, see ./include folder.


### Reference to other hash tables
There are many other hash tables, but I found that all of them are focused on performance, sacrificing exactly what I needâ€”persistence of pointers and iterators. However, there are some serious attempts. Consider reading the [results](https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-01-overview/) of benchmark made by people behind `robin_hood::hash_table`. I also recommend this [reading](https://greg7mdp.github.io/parallel-hashmap/) from Greg Popovic.

### Benchmark
See "benchmark" folder for code. 
Here are the results for 1 million ints. 
```bash

### Implementation details
Indeed, to nail down all the data, one should use a linked list. The problem is that random memory placement turns out to be bad for cache locality.

But thanks to [Bloomberg](https://github.com/bloomberg) and their contribution to committee work, we have `std:pmr` namespace and polymorphic allocators.
Long story short, this hash table is built upon `std::pmr::list` that allows to place list nodes in memory in an array-like fashion, thus making such a container more cache-friendly.

My hypothesis is that after some insert / remove cycles this hash table will deteriorate in performance -- "pogrom is a pogrom", list is a list, appearance of "holes" in that initial array-like placement is inevitable.
